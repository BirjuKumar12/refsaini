Common refrigerants include R-22, used in older systems but now being phased out due to its ozone-depleting properties, and R-410A, which is a more energy-efficient, non-ozone-depleting alternative for modern ACs. R-134A is widely used in refrigerators and car ACs but is less efficient than newer options. R-290 (Propane), an eco-friendly refrigerant with low global warming potential (GWP), is used in small refrigerators and ACs. R-404A is found in commercial refrigeration and chillers, while R-32, with its lower GWP, is becoming the preferred choice for newer air conditioners. R-407C is often used as a retrofit for R-22 systems, and R-744 (Carbon Dioxide) is a natural refrigerant with no GWP used in specialized commercial refrigeration. As environmental concerns grow, newer refrigerants like R-1234yf are being used in automotive ACs to reduce impact."
